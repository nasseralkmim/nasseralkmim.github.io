      <description>Introduction  This is an attempt to compile different sources of informations about Natural Language processing with python.
  Techiniques used in NLP  Tokenization  Converts text into segments (n-grams) that could represent a word, two words or more. During this step, usually it is performed some kind of vocabulary reduction such as normalization, stemming, lemmatization and removing stop words.
Tools    NLTK: string processing library, built by academics.</description>

      <description>Introduction   spaCy is a library for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in python. It offers multiple solutions for text processing such as tokenization, named entity recognition, word vectors, part of speech tagging. The alternative is the library NLTK which seems to be used mostly in academia whereas spaCy is recommended for production use.
  Load the language model  We need to download the models for the language with python -m spacy download model-name.</description>
