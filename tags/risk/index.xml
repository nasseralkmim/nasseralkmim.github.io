      <description>I was watching this lecture from professor Andrew Loo and he presented a compelling analogy to understand the difference between risk and uncertainty.  The analogy goes as follows:    urn A with 50 red balls and 50 black balls, pick a color and draw, if you draw your color you win $10,000.    urn B with unknown quantities, pick a color and draw, same prize.</description>
