      <description>I recently started my PhD at the University of Innsbruck, and will start share some of my day to day life and work here.
 Innsbruck is the capital of a region called Tirol. It is not a big city, the first thing I noticed when arrived here through the train station is how quick you can get to places with the rail train system.
 The city is very organized, and I was really impressed with the tiny gap between the rail train and the concrete sidewalk.</description>
