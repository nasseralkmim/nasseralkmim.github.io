      <description>Bags   The large bag, which costs only 0,79 EUR are good for laundry, groceries, moving things around. It is also good because it packs small and can be easily carried.
 The smaller ones can be used for organizing clothes in the wardrobe and be used as packing cubes when traveling.
  Pots and pans   In regards cooking utensil, IKEA offers the most quality for the price.</description>

      <description>I recently started my PhD at the University of Innsbruck, and will start share some of my day to day life and work here.
 Innsbruck is the capital of a region called Tirol. It is not a big city, the first thing I noticed when arrived here through the train station is how quick you can get to places with the rail train system.
 The city is very organized, and I was really impressed with the tiny gap between the rail train and the concrete sidewalk.</description>
