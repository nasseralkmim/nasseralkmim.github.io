BIS Bulletins   As of now, 2020, this are my favorite asthetic. The shaded background, no border, consistent line thickness and colors.   Old preferences  Eckardt 2011  This is one seems to be standard matplotlib plot. It is from a paper (Unger ad Eckardt 2011)
  Toro 2016  I think this one was made with TiKz library.</description>
