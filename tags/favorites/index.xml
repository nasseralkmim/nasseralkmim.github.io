      <description>Base layer  All good options, get the one on sale. Black or orange for consistency.
Karrimor quarter zip €15,00   Cheapest one, still waiting to check quality. Update: I tested the t-shirt. The quality is ok, good enough to run with.
  Craft CORE gain €35,00    Nike pacer 1/2 zip €40,00      Insulation  Should be black, because outer layer is orange already and you don&amp;#39;t want to be a clown.</description>

      <title>Favorites from IKEA 2021</title>

      <description>Why Ikea is so good?   The one thing that makes IKEA aesthetics stand out is consistency.
  Bags   The large bag, which costs only 0,79 EUR are good for laundry, groceries, moving things around. It is also good because it packs small and can be easily carried.
 The smaller ones can be used for organizing clothes in the wardrobe and be used as packing cubes when traveling.</description>

      <title>Favorite typeface</title>

      <description>Iosevka is currently my favorite typeface, really above anything I have tried. Every time I try something new I think it is ugly or rough. I use the quasi-proportional variations: Sparkle for coding and Aile for general text.</description>

      <description>Here I&amp;#39;m going to compile a list of my favorite graphs and plots.
BIS Bulletins   As of now, 2020, this are my favorite asthetic. The shaded background, no border, consistent line thickness and colors.   Old preferences  Eckardt 2011  This is one seems to be standard matplotlib plot. It is from a paper (Unger ad Eckardt 2011)
  Toro 2016  I think this one was made with TiKz library.</description>
