      <description>Introduction   Some people say that monetary easing by the central bank in the past decade is not affecting the CPI but the asset prices (stocks and bonds).
 To see how this is wrong (?) we need to understand inflation, monetary policy and modern finance.
  Inflation   Results from excess demand for goods and the ability of the supply side to provide.
Monetarist   Right wingers can be so fanciful about their intellectual inheritance.</description>

      <description>Traditional MP  FED  FED uses its reserves (liabilities) to affect the Federal Funds Rate (FFR), short term interest rate.
 If the FED reduces reserves, buying T-Bills in the open market operations, it affects the FFR upwards.
  Money Market dealers  Money market (MM) dealers are directly affected because they borrow short (overnight) and lend in term (3 months).
 If the financing cost increases, the MM dealers also push the term price upwards.</description>
