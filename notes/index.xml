      <description>Efficiency  I was impressed by the efficiency of two particular services that I&amp;#39;ve used. One of which was the supermarket and the other the post mail service.
 The affordable supermarket, Hoffer or Aldi, has impressive operations processes. Primo, they do not unpack all products into shelfs, they just open the boxes and pilled them up. This is way easier and faster than manually remove all items from boxes.</description>

      <description>Introduction  Jacobi method is a standard iterative scheme for solving the linear system $Ax=b$. It is part of what is known as relaxation-based methods, together with Gauss-Seidel.
 The basic idea is to write the diagonal product as a function of off-diagonal ones.
  Ax=b  Take this simple linear system of equations.
import numpy as np A = np.array([[3, 1, -1], [1, -4, 2], [-2, -1, 5]]) b = np.</description>

      <description>Introduction   These are my notes about C++. Mostly experiments and running examples with org-babel.
 I will follow mostly:
  A tour of C++
  Programming principles and practices using C++
    Technicalities  Declarations and definitions  Declaration introduces a name into a scope. It is different from defining something. A declaration that specifies the entity is a definition.
 Before a name can be used it must be declared.</description>

      <description>Emacs  Emacs, of course.
 Tried briefly overleaf, it was good first. Nice to have instant previews and so on.
 But then, it got little complicated with the bibliography export from Zotero. If I add a reference to zotero I have to manually update the bibliography, and it also takes some time to update. Real downside.
 Another minor problem that I anticipated is when I create figures with scripts, I would have to manually upload then (?</description>

      <description>Why Ikea is so good?   The one thing that makes IKEA aesthetics stand out is consistency.
  Bags   The large bag, which costs only 0,79 EUR are good for laundry, groceries, moving things around. It is also good because it packs small and can be easily carried.
 The smaller ones can be used for organizing clothes in the wardrobe and be used as packing cubes when traveling.</description>

      <description>I recently started my PhD at the University of Innsbruck, and will start share some of my day to day life and work here.
 Innsbruck is the capital of a region called Tirol. It is not a big city, the first thing I noticed when arrived here through the train station is how quick you can get to places with the rail train system.
 The city is very organized, and I was really impressed with the tiny gap between the rail train and the concrete sidewalk.</description>

      <description>Old view of banking   Discretionary bank decision to expand its balance sheet and therefore expandid credit to entepreneurs with positive net present value projects.
 Sometimes these project may never yield returns and we have a break in the payments chain, causing a crisis.
  New view of banking   Banks as intermediaries that face daily liquidity constraints, or clearing constraint.
 This constraint is enforced by a reserve limitation that banks must follow.</description>

    Crypto as an alternative to credit  What is credit?   One of the key features of crypto is its manufactured scarcity. Whereas current fiat money can be created by the central bank expansion of its balance sheet (increasing both assets and liabilities).</description>

      <description>Problems for hedge funds   Short squeeze   Brokers and margin call   Brokers got margin call by the clearinghouse. On other hand, brokers should have margin called the short sellers to cover their positions. But they did not do that, because it would most certainly cause the short sellers to just default.
 If the short sellers were margin called they would be required to buy shares at whatever price and this would put upward pressure to the price.</description>

He reckons we could approach 90% passive and we might not notice any issues, and that will take a long long time.. He points out - rightly - that there are plenty of companies that are mostly owned by the founder or parent company, but no one thinks that price discovery is materially impaired.</description>

      <description>Fischer&amp;#39;s quote:
 stock prices are informative if they are between “one-half” and “twice” their fundamental values.
  Here he is saying that when in normal times, in the range [0.5, 2], stock prices are in fact informative. However when an event that largely deviates from the standard deviation (Mandelbrot), we call this event a Black Swan (Taleb), stock prices does not contain information about value.

      <description>Portfolio theory   Markowitz calculou o desvio padrão de uma carteira por meio da covariança entre os ativos que compõem a carteira. Com isso obteve uma relação entre retorno e desvio padrão da carteira, que entendia como medida de risco.
 Além disso, outra conclusão importante: o risco de uma carteira não é simplesmente a soma da variância de cada ativo mas a soma das covariâncias. Portanto, é possível a combinação de dois ativos com retornos voláteis para gerar uma carteira menos volátil se por exemplo quando um ativo cai de preço o outro aumenta, ou seja, são correlacionados negativamente.</description>

      <description>Dinheiro e crédito  O que é dinheiro? O que é crédito? Os dois são lados da mesma moeda. Dinheiro é o meio de liquidar acordos que maturaram, means of settlement. Crédito é uma forma de postergar essa liquidação para o futuro.
 Os diversos ativos financeiros: reservas no Banco Central, ouro, moeda local, depósitos e securities (títulos), podem ser entendidos ora como dinheiro ora como crédito. Um depósito é uma promessa de pagar moeda local, um título pode ser uma promessa de pagar um depósito, e assim por diante.</description>

      <description>Introdução  E ai? quanto rendeu seu portfólio? Fácil, $$R_p = V_{final}/V_{inicial} - 1$$ certo? sim, se você investiu em um único aporte. Normalmente, as pessoas fazem vários aportes ao longo do tempo. Então, se você fez um aporte de 1.000,00, e depois fez outro aporte de 1.000,00; o valor final do seu portfólio é 2.000,00. Se usarmos a fórmula acima iremos obter 100% de retorno, isso indica &amp;#34;performance&amp;#34;?</description>

      <guid>https://nasseralkmim.github.io/notes/asset-price-inflation/</guid>
      <description>Introduction   Some people say that monetary easing by the central bank in the past decade is not affecting the CPI but the asset prices (stocks and bonds).
 To see how this is wrong (?) we need to understand inflation, monetary policy and modern finance.
  Inflation   Results from excess demand for goods and the ability of the supply side to provide.
Monetarist   Right wingers can be so fanciful about their intellectual inheritance.</description>

      <description>I was watching this lecture from professor Andrew Loo and he presented a compelling analogy to understand the difference between risk and uncertainty.
 The analogy goes as follows:
  urn A with 50 red balls and 50 black balls, pick a color and draw, if you draw your color you win $10,000.
  urn B with unknown quantities, pick a color and draw, same prize.
  The question is how much you are willing to bet?</description>

      <description>Traditional MP  FED  FED uses its reserves (liabilities) to affect the Federal Funds Rate (FFR), short term interest rate.
 If the FED reduces reserves, buying T-Bills in the open market operations, it affects the FFR upwards.
  Money Market dealers  Money market (MM) dealers are directly affected because they borrow short (overnight) and lend in term (3 months).
 If the financing cost increases, the MM dealers also push the term price upwards.</description>

      <description>What was LTCM trade?  They traded spreads in the bond market. Buying under priced bonds and short sell overpriced ones, then wait them to converge to a fair value and unwind the trade. Tiny spreads can be amplified with leverage.
 Long term means that this convergence of prices can take some time.
  Why it failed?   A crises in Asian and Russia made all LTCM trades to diverge, risking insolvency by reducing its long position value and increasing its short.</description>

  Change of basis   Let&amp;#39;s say we have two sets of basis vector $\color{blue}{\boldsymbol{b_{i}}}$ and $\color{red}{\boldsymbol{\beta_{i}}}$. The set $\color{blue}{\boldsymbol{b_{i}}}$ defines the original system, the one we start with, and the set $\color{red}{\boldsymbol{\beta_{i}}}$ the transformed system.</description>

Usually this process is boring since you have to add a source into your .bib file, then insert the citation with the bibtex key into your latex to generate the references section. This process is independent of your .pdf source, so you can add citation for source that you have physically.</description>

 \begin{equation} \mathbb{(P)} \; \begin{cases} \min \limits_{x_1, x_2} (x_1 -3)^2 + (x_2 + 1)^2 \\ s.</description>

      <description>Introduction   This is an experiment with org-mode and ob-python that simulates a notebok environment which mix code, text and math (latex). I am going through example presented in John Kitchin work, which is extremely useful for someone planning on start coding in python for science.  I take no credit from the material presented here, it is a copy with a new format. I am particularly interested in this subject due an ongoing project in structural optimization therefore I will put an effort on detailing some of the method derivation.</description>
